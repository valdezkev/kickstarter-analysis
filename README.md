## Overview of Project: 
The goal of this project was to help Louise understand all the data about the funraising campaign. With the help of visualizations like graphs, charts and spreadsheets. 

## Analysis and Challenges:

### With the help of Filters, we can help Louise find specific data quickly. Filters are great for finding or temporarily eliminating data that you do not want to see or vice versa.

This image shows the Outcomes based on Goal in two different ways. The first way is in the spreadsheet with only numbers. You can see the successful, failed and canceled based on goals on the left. The second way is with a line graph. You can immediately see where the data intersected three times. Those three times are the percentages of about 50% where they were successful and failed. 
One of the challenges I encountered was how to write the equation for the countifs, but with trial and error, eventually was able to figure it out.

## Results:
One of the conclusions you can make about Theater Outcomes based on Launch Date is that the month of May had the highest successful launches. Another conclusion you can make is that, comopared to the successful, the cancled were in the low numbers. Good news for Louise. 
For Outcomes Based on Goal, you can see in the line graph that successful and failed percentages were almost exaclty the same just flipped.
